#Chapter 5: Compute Tuition

'''
(Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose that the tuition for a university
is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year. Write a program that
computes the tuition in ten years and the total cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition
starting ten years from now.
